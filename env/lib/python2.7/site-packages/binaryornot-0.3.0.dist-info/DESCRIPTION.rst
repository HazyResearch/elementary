Ultra-lightweight pure Python package to guess whether a file is binary or text,
using a heuristic similar to Perl's `pp_fttext` and its analysis by @eliben.

* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: http://binaryornot.readthedocs.org

Status
------

It works, and I'm using this package in various places. But it doesn't cover all edge cases yet.

The code could be improved. Pull requests welcome! As of now, it is based on these snippets, but that may change:

* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/898669/how-can-i-detect-if-a-file-is-binary-non-text-in-python
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1446549/how-to-identify-binary-and-text-files-using-python
* http://code.activestate.com/recipes/173220/
* http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/10/19/perls-guess-if-file-is-text-or-binary-implemented-in-python/

Features
--------

Has tests for these file types:

* Text: .css, .json, .txt, .svg
* Binary: .eot, .otf, ttf, .woff, .png, .jpg, .tiff, .bmp

Why?
----

You may be thinking, "I can write this in 2 lines of code?!"

It's actually not that easy. Here's a great article about how *perldoc*'s
heuristic to guess file types works: http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/10/19/perls-guess-if-file-is-text-or-binary-implemented-in-python/

Also, this package saves you from having to write and thoroughly test
those 2 lines of code with all sorts of weird file types, cross-platform.
